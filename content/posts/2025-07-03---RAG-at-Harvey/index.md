I wrote some blog posts about the many interesting challenges of building Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) at Harvey! Here are 3 of them.

1. [Deep Research](https://www.harvey.ai/blog/integrating-deep-research-into-harvey). Open source [code here](https://github.com/harveyai/deep-research-starter)
2. [Enterprise-Grade RAG Systems](https://www.harvey.ai/blog/enterprise-grade-rag-systems)
3. [Harvey co-builds custom model for tax with PwC](https://www.harvey.ai/blog/harvey-co-builds-custom-model-for-tax-with-pwc√ü)
4. [Harvey partners with Voyage to build custom legal embeddings](https://www.harvey.ai/blog/harvey-partners-with-voyage-to-build-custom-legal-embeddings)
